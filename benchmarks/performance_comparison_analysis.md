## Root Cause Analysis

### Platform Performance Differences

The performance differences are primarily attributed to:

1. **CPU Architecture**:
   - Apple Silicon has superior single-core performance and memory bandwidth
   - Apple's unified memory architecture provides faster memory access
   - M-series chips have optimized execution units for specific workloads

2. **Compiler Optimizations**:
   - Apple Clang may have better target-specific optimizations for Apple Silicon
   - Different instruction sets and optimization paths

3. **System I/O**:
   - Apple's SSD controllers and memory subsystem are highly optimized
   - Linux on AWS may have virtualization overhead

### Code Changes Impact

To determine if there are actual code regressions:
- Need to test on the same hardware/platform with previous vs current code
- Current differences appear to be primarily **platform-related**, not code regressions

## Conclusions

### Performance Status
1. **No Evidence of Code Regression**: The performance differences appear to be platform-related rather than due to code changes
2. **Competitive Advantage Maintained**: Still 2.5-6x faster than competitors on Linux
3. **Absolute Performance**: Still excellent (sub-second for 13MB files)

### Recommendations
1. **✅ Performance is Acceptable**: Current performance is still excellent and competitive
2. **Consider Platform-Specific Optimization**: Different optimization flags for Linux vs macOS
3. **Benchmark Consistency**: Use same hardware for before/after comparisons
4. **No Action Required**: No significant performance regression in code

### Final Assessment
**No performance degradation detected in the code changes.** The observed differences are primarily due to platform/hardware differences between Apple Silicon (macOS) and x86_64 (Linux/AWS). The tool maintains excellent performance characteristics and competitive advantages on both platforms.
